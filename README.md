So you want to build a rocket. That's cool, you've found the right team for it.

But you also value your time. As you should.

Inevitably, over the course of your invaluable ICLR experience, you've often found yourself wondering...

*Why should designing any hobby-scale rocket take months, or even years? Seriously?*

In theory, a rocket is nothing more than a fancy mash-up of tubes, wood, chutes, strings, screws and fireworks. And a party-hat.

That's it, that's literally it. Throw in some electronics for recovery systems and you've got a functional rocket. Noice.

What I'm saying is, the *rocket* *platform* for testing, say, novel payloads, crazy mission profiles or fancy propulsion systems, is really not an advanced idea. So the question is...

*Why does development take so long?! And how do we as a team streamline the process?*

As engineers, you want to focus your efforts on the bits of your rocket which set it apart. Yet you find yourself trapped in the endless details of sizing and integration.

*Sizing and Integration are circular problems. Always have been.*

The problem lies in how we translate high-level design requirements into practical design limits for each component. And how we enforce these requirements.

Valispace offers a solution to many of these problems, but ultimately, manually assigning requirements every time is more effort than just opening OpenRocket, F360 and getting on with it.
