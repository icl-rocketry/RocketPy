# RocketPy - Smarter Requirements

- Designed for later compatibility with GPKit
- Objective() defines top-level objectives - categorised into Mission and Programmatics
- Requirements can be either functional (system/component should do xxx) or non-functional (system/component should be xxx)
- Require() ---> Constraint()
- Require() ---> RootRequire()
